# Basic configuration for a Next.js SSR backend on Firebase App Hosting
# For more options, see https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/frameworks/express

# Specifies the version of the App Hosting YAML schema.
# Version 1 is the latest.
schemaVersion: 1

# Describes the entry point for your SSR application.
# This configuration assumes your Next.js app is built using 'npm run build'
# and the output directory is '.next'.
run:
  # Specifies the command to start your Next.js application.
  # 'npm run start' is the typical command for a production Next.js build.
  command: npm run start
  # Specifies the Node.js version.
  # Adjust this if your project requires a different Node.js version.
  # Common LTS versions are '20', '18'.
  # For Next.js, it's good to use a version compatible with your Next.js version.
  nodeVersion: 20

# Describes the build process for your Next.js application.
build:
  # Specifies the command to build your Next.js application.
  # 'npm run build' is the standard command.
  command: npm run build
  # Specifies the output directory where Next.js places the build artifacts.
  # '.next' is the default output directory for Next.js.
  outputDir: .next

# Defines the scaling configuration for your App Hosting backend.
scaling:
  # Minimum number of instances that will be kept running.
  # Setting to 0 allows Firebase to scale down to zero during periods of no traffic,
  # which can save costs, but may result in slower responses for the first request (cold start).
  # minInstances: 0
  # For better initial performance and to avoid cold starts, you might set it to 1.
  minInstances: 1

  # Maximum number of instances that Firebase can scale up to.
  # Setting this to 10 as requested.
  maxInstances: 10

  # Concurrency controls how many requests a single instance can handle simultaneously.
  # Default is usually fine, but you can adjust if needed.
  # concurrency: 80

  # CPU allocation for each instance.
  # Default is 1 CPU.
  # cpu: 1

  # Memory allocation for each instance.
  # Default is '512MiB'. Options include '256MiB', '1GiB', '2GiB', etc.
  # memory: "512MiB"

# Environment variables that will be available to your application.
# Add any environment variables your Next.js application needs here.
# Example:
# env:
#   - variable: API_KEY
#     value: "your_api_key_here"
#   - variable: DATABASE_URL
#     secret: YOUR_DATABASE_URL_SECRET # For secrets stored in Google Secret Manager

# Defines how HTTP requests are routed to your application.
# This basic configuration routes all requests to your Next.js run command.
# For more complex routing or static asset serving, refer to Firebase documentation.
serving:
  # The ID of the run configuration defined above.
  # All incoming requests will be handled by this run configuration.
  run: default # 'default' typically refers to the 'run' block defined above.
               # If you name your run block differently, update this value.
